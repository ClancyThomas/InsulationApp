# Insulation Calculator App

# Overview

This is an attic insulation quote calculator app. I created this in order to help solve an issue that I experienced while working as an insulation salesman where the online quote calculator wouldn't work in areas with poor service. I was interested in learning about app development and specifically iOS app development. This project can be considered a minimum viable product.

# Development Environment

* Swift & SwiftUI
* xCode (Version 14.0)
* Git / Github

# Public Use Information

Anyone can use this source code and adjust it for their needs. This version of the app does not have exact pricing and doesn't contain all the items that may exist in an actual quote. Additional quote features can easily be added to the source code and prices can easily be adjusted with the AtticQuoteObject.swift file
